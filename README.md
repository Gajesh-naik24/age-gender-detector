# age-gender-detector
This Python script uses OpenCV and deep learning models to detect faces and predict gender and age in images or video streams. It draws bounding boxes around faces and displays predicted gender and age in real-time. It supports live video feed processing and works with pre-trained models for face detection and classification.
